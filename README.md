## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to:
1. Preprocess email text data (cleaning, tokenization, stemming)
2. Extract TF-IDF features
3. Train and compare two classification models:
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
4. Evaluate model performance with metrics and visualizations

## Features

  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Two classification models
- Performance evaluation:
  - Classification reports
  - Confusion matrices
  - Accuracy scores
